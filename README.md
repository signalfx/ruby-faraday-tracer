# Faraday::Tracer

OpenTracing compatible Faraday middleware:

* It wraps all outgoing requests in spans
* It adds the trace context to outgoing requests

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'signalfx-faraday-tracer'
```

## Usage

### Using request context

```ruby
require 'opentracing'
OpenTracing.global_tracer = TracerImplementation.new

require 'faraday'
require 'faraday/tracer'

conn = Faraday.new(url: 'http://localhost:3000/') do |faraday|
  # Add tracing support
  faraday.use Faraday::Tracer

  # default Faraday stack
  faraday.request :url_encoded
  faraday.adapter Faraday.default_adapter
end

span = request.env['rack.span'] # when using rack-tracer gem

conn.post('/test') do |request|
  # Leave undefined or set span to nil if there's no existing span
  request.options.context = {span: span}
end
```


### Defining span in the connection builder

```ruby
require 'opentracing'
OpenTracing.global_tracer = TracerImplementation.new

require 'faraday'
require 'faraday/tracer'

# Use already existing span to use it as as a parent span. In case there is no
# existing span leave it nil to start a new trace.
span = request.env['rack.span'] # when using rack-tracer gem

conn = Faraday.new(url: 'http://localhost:3000/') do |faraday|
  faraday.use Faraday::Tracer, span: span

  # default Faraday stack
  faraday.request :url_encoded
  faraday.adapter Faraday.default_adapter
end
```

### Span name

By default, all spans are given a default name. You may also override this by
passing a `:span_name` in the middleware options hash and/or the request
options.

### Service name

It's possible to define the remote service name by using `:service_name` option.
